Welcome @{{ target }}! :tada:

A developer or maintainer will soon invite you to the organization.

Meanwhile, to get started, please follow our [newcomers guide] (https://coala.io/newcomer) and skip instructions using corobo. Most issues will be explained there and in linked pages - it will save you a lot of time, just read it. *Really.*

After accepting the invitation, you can get yourself assigned to an issue using `corobo assign <issue_link>`.

*Do not take an issue if you don't understand it on your own.* Especially if you are new you have to be aware that getting started with an open source community is not trivial: you will have to work hard and most likely become a better coder than you are now just as we all did.

Don't get us wrong: we are *very* glad to have you with us on this journey into open source! We will also be there for you at all times to help you with actual problems. :)
